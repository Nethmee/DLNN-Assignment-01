# DLLNN-Assignment-01
This Assignment is based on basic Python Programming Concepts

## Instructions

1. Implement codes for the problems given in PYTHON programming language
2. Create a .zip file contating all the codes of the Assignment and submit through [aie.kaduwela@gmail.com](aie.kaduwela@gmail.com) on or before the given deadline

## Questions

#### 1. Design a results forum for a school. When teacher enter the marks of a student. The program should be able to display the grade and PASS or FAIL

Grading Criterion:
```  
00<marks<35, Grade D-
30<=mark<35, Grade D
35<=mark<40. Grade D+
40<=mark<45, Grade C-
45<=mark<50, Grade C
50<=mark<55, Grade C+
55<=mark<60, Grade B-
60<=mark<65, Grade B
65<=mark<75, Grade B+
75<=mark<80, Grade A-
80<=mark<90, Grade A
90<=mark<=100, Grade A+ 
```

-Pass Mark is 45
-If the Mark is not in the range of 0 to 100, display “ERROR! Please enter a numerical value between 0 to 100”.
Example: when Mark=64, your program should display “Student is PASS, Grade B”

#### 2. Write a program to calculate someone’s age in Years, Months and Days. Get 6 user inputs from the user, 3 for Today’s date (year, month and day) another 3 inputs for the user’s birth day (year, month and day).

-Assume that all the months of a year have 30 days.

#### 3. Write a program to Calculate the Electricity Bill of a House, when user inputs the amount of Units consumed in a particular month.

Charging Criterion: 
```  
Tariff Block(Units)   Unit Rate(Rs.)
0<units<30                  5/-
30<=units<60                20/-
60<=units<120               150/-
120<units<200               500/-
Units>=200                  1000/-
```
Example: If the amount of units consumed is 55, Charge = (29x5) + (25x20) =645/-

#### 4. Write a code to print the PRIME numbers from 0 to 1000.

Definition of prime number: A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, whose only two whole-number factors are 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
Hint: use nested loops and conditions
```  
Example:    2 is a prime
            3 is a prime
            5 is a prime
            7 is a prime
            11 is a prime
```
#### 5. Write a program to Multiply the following matrices and print the result matrix.

Hint: Use 2D Arrays
